[x] compositional design for parking time calculation

[x] 150 cents yields 60 minutes parking time (1st hour of progressive rate)
[x] 350 cents yields 120 minutes parking time (2nd hour of progressive rate)
[x] 650 cents yields 180 minutes parking time (3rd hour of progressive rate)
[x] 655 cents yields 182 minutes of parking time (after 3rd hour of progressive rate)

[x] compositional design for coin validation
[x] 1 DKK is valid

[x] 5 DKK is valid
[x] 10 DKK is valid
[x] 20 DKK is valid
[x] 0.5 DKK is invalid

[x] integration of CoinStrategies and PayStation
[x] integration of RateStrategies and PayStation

[x] 1 krone yields 7 minutes parking time
[x] 3 kroner yields 21 minutes parking time

[x] 1 krone yields 6 minutes parking time
[x] 20 kroner yields 120 minutes parking time
[x] 21 kroner yields 125 minutes parking time

[x] initializeCoins maps all valid kroner to 0
[x] universally moving coins from transactionCoins to earnedCoins updates both maps accordingly
[x] universally calculating parking time by accumulating a transaction coin total

[x] initializeCoins maps all valid cents to 0
[x] refactor 'dollar' to 'cents'
[x] initializeCoins in TestingCoinStrategy
[x] refactor all uses of HashMap to LinkedHashMap

[x] 500 cents yields 200 minutes on weekday
